import { useContentAccess } from '../contexts/MonetizationContext';

const { generateAudioGuideWithValidation } = useContentAccess();

const handleGenerateAudio = async (attractionId: string, attractionName: string) => {
  const result = await generateAudioGuideWithValidation(attractionId, attractionName);
  
  if (result.canGenerate) {
    // Proceed with your existing audio generation
    await yourExistingAudioGenerationFunction(attractionId);
  } else if (result.shouldShowPaywall && result.paywallContext) {
    // Paywall will show automatically via context
    console.log('Paywall triggered for:', attractionName);
  }
