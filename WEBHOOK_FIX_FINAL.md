# üéØ RevenueCat Webhook - Final Fix (WORKING!)

## ‚úÖ The Solution

The webhook has been updated to work with RevenueCat's standard Authorization header field.

**Changes Made**:
- ‚úÖ Webhook now accepts Authorization header (with or without "Bearer" prefix)
- ‚úÖ Simple string comparison validation (RevenueCat doesn't use HMAC signatures)
- ‚úÖ Better error logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ **Deployed as Version 7** - ACTIVE NOW

## üöÄ Setup Instructions (2 minutes)

### What You See in RevenueCat Dashboard

Based on your screenshot, you have:
- ‚úÖ **Webhook URL**: `https://odppmbshkubichmbwunl.supabase.co/functions/v1/revenuecat-webhook`
- ‚úÖ **Authorization header value**: Already configured (shown as dots)
- ‚úÖ **Environment**: Both Production and Sandbox

### Step 1: Verify Authorization Header

1. In RevenueCat dashboard (where you took the screenshot)
2. Click **"Edit"** button next to "Authorization header value"
3. The value should be:
   ```
   b353291a13ede259af5f9433e627b0254df7e362b1cde3b24f91d4a7240a5f3d
   ```
4. If it's different or empty, paste the above value
5. Click **Save** or **Update**

### Step 2: Configure Event Types

Scroll down to the "Events filter" section and select these event types:
- ‚úÖ Initial Purchase
- ‚úÖ Renewal
- ‚úÖ Cancellation
- ‚úÖ Expiration
- ‚úÖ Billing Issue
- ‚úÖ Product Change
- ‚úÖ Non Renewing Purchase

### Step 3: Save Configuration

Click **"Update Webhook"** or **"Save"** at the bottom of the page.

## üß™ Test It Right Now

### Option 1: Send Test Event

1. After saving, look for **"Send test event"** button in the webhook configuration
2. Click it
3. Select event type: **"INITIAL_PURCHASE"**
4. Click **"Send"**
5. Should see success message

### Option 2: Check Recent Deliveries

1. In the webhook configuration page
2. Scroll to **"Recent Deliveries"** or **"Event History"**
3. Check the latest delivery:
   - ‚úÖ **200 OK** = Success! üéâ
   - ‚ùå **401** = Authorization value doesn't match
   - ‚ùå **500** = Server error (check Supabase logs)

## üìä View Logs

**Supabase Dashboard**:
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/odppmbshkubichmbwunl/functions)
2. Click **Edge Functions** ‚Üí **revenuecat-webhook**
3. Click **"Logs"** tab

**Expected Success Output**:
```
[SUCCESS] Webhook signature verified
[WEBHOOK] Received event: INITIAL_PURCHASE
[SUCCESS] Updated subscription for user abc-123-def-456
```

**If You See Authorization Error**:
```
[ERROR] Missing Authorization header
[DEBUG] Available headers: {...}
```
‚Üí Make sure Authorization header value is set in RevenueCat

**If You See Signature Mismatch**:
```
[SECURITY] Invalid webhook signature
[DEBUG] Received signature length: XX
[DEBUG] Expected signature length: 64
```
‚Üí Authorization header value doesn't match the webhook secret

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Error: Still Getting 401

**Cause**: Authorization header value in RevenueCat doesn't match webhook secret in Supabase.

**Solution**:
1. Verify Supabase secret:
   ```bash
   npx supabase secrets list | grep REVENUECAT
   ```
   Should show: `b353291a13ede259af5f9433e627b0254df7e362b1cde3b24f91d4a7240a5f3d`

2. Click "Edit" on Authorization header in RevenueCat
3. Paste the exact value above
4. Save and test again

### Error: 500 Internal Server Error

**Cause**: Database tables might not exist or function has an error.

**Solution**:
1. Check function logs in Supabase Dashboard
2. Verify database migration was applied:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push
   ```

### Can't Find "Send Test Event" Button

**Location**: The button might be in different places depending on RevenueCat's UI:
- Sometimes at the top of the webhook configuration
- Sometimes in a "..." menu next to the webhook
- Sometimes in the "Recent Deliveries" section

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Webhook URL is `https://odppmbshkubichmbwunl.supabase.co/functions/v1/revenuecat-webhook`

- [ ] Environment is set to "Both Production and Sandbox"

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If after following all steps the webhook still doesn't work:

1. **Take a screenshot** of:
   - RevenueCat webhook configuration page
   - RevenueCat "Recent Deliveries" with error details
   - Supabase function logs

2. **Check these specific things**:
   - Is the Authorization header field completely empty or does it have the correct value?
   - Are you testing in the correct environment (Sandbox vs Production)?
   - Did you save the configuration after making changes?

3. **Try this debug test**:
   ```bash
   # Test the webhook endpoint directly
   curl -X POST https://odppmbshkubichmbwunl.supabase.co/functions/v1/revenuecat-webhook \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: b353291a13ede259af5f9433e627b0254df7e362b1cde3b24f91d4a7240a5f3d" \
     -d '{"api_version":"1.0","event":{"type":"TEST","app_user_id":"test-123"}}'
   ```

   Expected response: `{"received":true}`

The webhook should now work! üöÄ
