3. **CORS Security** ✅
   - ❌ Replaced wildcard CORS policy (`*`) 
   - ✅ Implemented origin validation in edge functions
   - ✅ Added security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
   - ✅ Restricted allowed origins to development and production domains

4. **Biometric Token Security** ✅
   - ❌ Replaced AsyncStorage with Expo SecureStore for sensitive tokens
   - ✅ Added token encryption and expiration (7 days)
   - ✅ Implemented secure credential lifecycle management
   - ✅ Added automatic token refresh handling

5. **Location Privacy Controls** ✅
   - ✅ Created comprehensive `PrivacyContext.tsx`
   - ✅ Implemented location precision controls (high/balanced/low)
   - ✅ Added location data obfuscation based on user preferences
   - ✅ Implemented consent management and data retention policies
   - ✅ Added user data export/deletion capabilities

### **Phase 3: Input Validation & Security Infrastructure** ✅
6. **Edge Function Security** ✅
   - ✅ Added comprehensive input validation
   - ✅ Implemented request body sanitization
   - ✅ Added size limits and type checking
   - ✅ Sanitized user inputs before AI prompt injection

7. **Rate Limiting Implementation** ✅
   - ✅ Implemented comprehensive rate limiting system with multiple policies
   - ✅ Added IP-based limits (100 requests per 15 minutes)
   - ✅ Added user-based limits (200 requests per 15 minutes for authenticated users)
   - ✅ Added endpoint-specific limits for expensive operations
   - ✅ Added streaming-specific rate limits
   - ✅ Implemented request quotas and monitoring with rate limit headers
   - ✅ Added timeout controls and circuit breaker patterns for external API calls

8. **Enhanced Error Handling** ✅
   - ✅ Implemented secure error handler with sensitive data sanitization
   - ✅ Added comprehensive error classification and user-friendly messages
   - ✅ Removed sensitive information from error responses
   - ✅ Added error statistics tracking and monitoring

9. **Secure Logging Framework** ✅
   - ✅ Implemented comprehensive logging system with privacy protection
   - ✅ Added structured logging with request tracing
   - ✅ Implemented sensitive data redaction patterns
   - ✅ Added security event logging for authentication, rate limiting, and validation
   - ✅ Added performance timing and monitoring
   - ✅ Integrated health check endpoint with error and log statistics

## 📋 **Remaining Tasks**

### **Phase 4: Advanced Security & Compliance** (1-3 months)
- [ ] **Security Monitoring & Alerting**
  - Advanced security event monitoring and correlation
  - Intrusion detection and automated response
  - Security monitoring dashboard and alerting system
  - Integration with external monitoring services

- [ ] **Database Security**
  - Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) configuration
  - Database access controls and audit logging
  - Encrypted data storage for sensitive fields

- [ ] **Compliance Framework**
  - GDPR/CCPA compliance implementation
  - Cookie consent management
  - Comprehensive privacy policy integration
  - Data retention automation and compliance auditing

---

## 🔧 **Configuration Required**

### **Environment Variables** (Required for deployment)
```bash
# Add to your deployment environment:
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### **Google Maps API Restrictions** (Recommended)
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Navigate to APIs & Credentials
3. Add domain restrictions for your API key
4. Enable only required APIs (Places, Maps)

### **Production CORS Configuration**
Update the allowed origins in `/supabase/functions/attraction-info/index.ts`:
```typescript
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://your-actual-domain.com',
  'https://your-app-domain.com'
];
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing Recommendations**

### **Security Testing**
1. **API Key Security**: Verify key is not exposed in app bundle
2. **Authentication**: Test biometric auth with token expiration
3. **Location Privacy**: Verify precision controls work correctly
4. **CORS Policy**: Test cross-origin requests are properly blocked
5. **Input Validation**: Test edge function input sanitization

### **Privacy Testing**
1. **Location Consent**: Test consent flow and revocation
2. **Data Deletion**: Verify user data can be completely removed
3. **Precision Controls**: Test location obfuscation at different levels
4. **Token Storage**: Verify secure storage on device
