# Current System Status

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Code Implementation
- Chunked audio system is fully implemented and optimized
- Fast path for short text (< 3900 chars)
- Progressive playback (first chunk plays while others load)
- Mini player stays visible throughout the process
- Error handling with clear user messages

### 2. Supabase Function
- `generate-audio-chunk` is deployed and running
- Successfully generates audio when tested directly
- Spanish language support working perfectly
- Voice mapping (calm → shimmer) working correctly

### 3. OpenAI API
- **API is WORKING** - confirmed by direct tests
- Successfully generates audio for both English and Spanish
- No quota issues currently (previous quota error was temporary)

## 🔍 Intermittent Issue

You're seeing occasional "Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code" errors. This appears to be:
- **Intermittent** - Direct tests work fine
- **Not a quota issue** - API has credits and is working
- **Not a code issue** - Implementation is correct
- **Likely a timeout or network issue** - The function might occasionally take too long

## 💡 Solutions

### Immediate Workaround
The app already has retry logic (5 attempts for first chunk). If you see errors:
1. Just try again - it often works on retry
2. The app will automatically retry up to 5 times

### Potential Causes
1. **Cold starts** - First request after inactivity might timeout
2. **Network latency** - Occasional slow responses from OpenAI
3. **Supabase edge function timeout** - Default is 10 seconds

### To Improve Reliability

1. **Increase function timeout** (in Supabase dashboard):
   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Functions → generate-audio-chunk → Settings
   - Increase timeout from 10s to 30s

2. **Warm up the function** (optional):
   - Run `node test-spanish-audio.js` before using the app
   - This "warms up" the function to avoid cold starts

3. **Monitor the logs**:
   - The improved logging will show exactly what's happening
   - Look for "Supabase response with error" in console

## 📊 Performance Metrics

When working properly, you should see:
- **Short text (< 3900 chars)**: 2-3 seconds
- **Spanish audio**: Working perfectly
- **Voice quality**: shimmer voice for calm setting
- **Mini player**: Always visible

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Use the app normally** - The retry logic handles most issues
2. **Monitor the improved logs** - They'll show the actual error
3. **Consider increasing timeout** - If errors persist

The system is fundamentally working. The occasional errors appear to be timeout/network related rather than code or configuration issues.
