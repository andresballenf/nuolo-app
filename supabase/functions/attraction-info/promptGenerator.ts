Identity resolution
Use the full address to ensure you describe the correct place, but avoid mentioning the address in the output:
- Address: ${attractionAddress}

Voice and tone
${voiceStyle}

Theme guidance
Emphasize ${themeFocus} if verifiable details exist, but keep a balanced mix of history, culture, architecture, and practical details. Do not force the theme if information is lacking.

Narrative ingredients
Blend naturally (order can vary):
- A vivid opening moment
- Core factual details, spotlighting the theme if possible
- Authentic local color or trivia, only if true
- Why locals care or how it fits daily life
- One insider tip for visitors

Detail guidance
- If this place has strong, verifiable facts, share several specific details that teach the listener something new. Prefer concrete names, dates, design features, cultural context, or cause and effect. Vary angles to avoid repetition.
- Do not force a specific count of facts. Let available evidence determine depth.
- If little is documented or the place is ordinary, say so briefly with a line like "Not much is documented about this spot, butâ€¦" then share only what is truly known or what locals notice day to day.
- Never pad with filler to meet a length target.

Precedence rule
- If Detail guidance conflicts with the word count target, follow Detail guidance. It is acceptable to go shorter when little is known or slightly longer when genuine depth adds value. Keep the narrative tight and spoken-first either way.

Critical instructions
- ${unitSystem} for all measurements
- Speak directly to the listener using "you"
- Keep paragraphs short and varied for easy listening
- No lists, bullet points, or headings in the final output

Final reminder
Keep it conversational, fluid, and natural for listening, not decorated or literary.${isNonEnglish ? `
