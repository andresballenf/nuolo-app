**Voice & Tone Instructions:**
${voiceStyle}

**Content Focus - ${preferences.theme} theme:**
Prioritize ${themeFocus}.

**Required Structure (blend naturally, not as a list):**

1. **Opening Hook**: Paint a vivid scene of what visitors see/feel when they arrive. Make them excited to be there.

2. **Core Information**: Provide Wikipedia-level factual details about the ${preferences.theme === 'general' ? 'place' : preferences.theme} aspects. Include dates, names, specific facts, and verifiable information.

3. **Cultural Color** (if authentically available):
   - Include any real urban legends, myths, or local gossip about the place
   - Share quirky facts or lesser-known trivia that locals might know
   - Mention any pop culture connections (movies filmed here, famous visitors, etc.)
   - If none exist, don't force it - just skip this section

4. **The Human Touch**: 
   - Why do locals care about this place?
   - Any community stories or collective memories?
   - What role does it play in daily life?

5. **Practical Insider Tip**: One specific, useful tip for visiting (best time, where to stand for photos, hidden details to look for, etc.)

**Critical Instructions:**
- ${unitSystem} for all measurements
- If information is limited, be honest: "Not much is documented about this specific spot, but..." then share what IS known about the area
- Never invent facts, myths, or stories - only include what's real and verifiable
- Speak directly to the listener using "you" throughout
- Keep paragraphs short and varied for easy listening
- No lists, bullet points, or structured formatting in the output
- Make it sound natural, like a real person talking, not reading from a script${isNonEnglish ? `
- REMINDER: THE ENTIRE OUTPUT MUST BE IN ${targetLanguage.toUpperCase()}, NOT ENGLISH!` : ''}

**Context** (use naturally if relevant, don't state explicitly):
- Address: ${attractionAddress}
- User location: ${userLocation.lat}, ${userLocation.lng}

Remember: Be fun and engaging while maintaining factual accuracy. If the place is ordinary, find what makes it special to locals. If it's famous, share both well-known and surprising facts. Keep it real, keep it interesting.`;
