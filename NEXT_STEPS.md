# Next Steps for OAuth Implementation

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status
The OAuth authentication code has been successfully implemented in your React Native app. The following has been completed:
- Installed necessary OAuth libraries (expo-auth-session, expo-crypto, expo-web-browser, expo-apple-authentication)
- Updated app.json with OAuth URL schemes and Apple Sign-In capability for iOS
- Implemented **native Apple Sign-In** on iOS using `expo-apple-authentication` (Supabase recommended approach)
- Implemented secure OAuth flow for Google using `expo-auth-session` with PKCE
- Added automatic profile creation for OAuth users
- OAuth buttons already exist in the UI (no changes needed)

## üîß Manual Configuration Required

### 1. Configure OAuth Providers in Supabase Dashboard

#### For Google OAuth:
1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project (Audigo MVP)
3. Navigate to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Providers**
4. Find **Google** in the list and enable it
5. Add the following from Google Cloud Console:
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret**

**To get Google credentials:**
- Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Create/select a project
- Enable Google+ API
- Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application type)
- Add redirect URI: `https://[YOUR-PROJECT-ID].supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

#### For Apple OAuth:
1. In Supabase Dashboard, find **Apple** provider
2. Enable Apple provider
3. Add the following from Apple Developer Portal:
   - **Services ID**
   - **Secret Key**

**To get Apple credentials:**
- Visit [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/)
- Register an App ID with Sign in with Apple capability
- Create a Services ID
- Generate a private key for Sign in with Apple

### 2. Create a Development Build

**Important:** OAuth authentication will NOT work in Expo Go. You must create a development build.

#### Option A: Local Build
```bash
# For iOS (Mac required)
npx expo run:ios

# For Android
npx expo run:android
```

#### Option B: EAS Build (Recommended for teams)
```bash
# Install EAS CLI if not already installed
npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure your project
eas build:configure

# Create development builds
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### 3. Test the OAuth Flow

After completing steps 1 and 2:
1. Install the development build on your device/simulator
2. Open the app
3. Navigate to the login or signup screen
4. Tap the "Google" or "Apple" button
5. Complete the OAuth flow
6. Verify you're redirected back to the app and logged in

## üì± Platform-Specific Notes

- **Apple Sign-In**: 
  - Only appears on iOS devices (this is intentional)
  - Uses native `expo-apple-authentication` for best user experience
  - Can be tested in Expo Go on iOS without Apple Developer account
  - Full name and email only provided on first sign-in
- **Google Sign-In**: 
  - Works on both iOS and Android
  - Uses OAuth flow with `expo-auth-session`
  - Requires development build (won't work in Expo Go)
- **Redirect URLs**: Already configured as `nuolo://auth` and `com.nuolo.app://auth`

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "OAuth doesn't work in Expo Go" | Create a development build using `expo run:ios` or `expo run:android` |
| "Authentication failed" error | Verify OAuth providers are enabled and credentials are correct in Supabase |
| No Apple button on Android | This is expected - Apple Sign-In only shows on iOS |
| Redirect not working | Ensure URL schemes in app.json match your bundle identifier |

## ‚ú® What Happens Automatically

- **New users**: Account is created automatically on first OAuth sign-in
- **Existing users**: Signed in to their existing account
- **Profile creation**: User profile is created with name and avatar from OAuth provider
- **Session persistence**: Sessions are saved and restored automatically

## üöÄ Ready to Test!

Once you've:
1. ‚úÖ Configured OAuth providers in Supabase Dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Created a development build
3. ‚úÖ Installed the app on a device

You're ready to test Google and Apple authentication in your app!
